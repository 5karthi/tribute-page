<p class="text"> Subhas Chandra Bose (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha],<br> India—died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan) Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence<br> movement against British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad against<br> the Western powers during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi,<br> at times an ally and at other times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his<br> militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.</p><br><br><br><br>
<br><p class="text"><br><br><br><br><Br><br><BR><b> 1941–1943: Collaboration with Nazi Germany </b>In Germany, Bose was attached <Br>to the Special Bureau <br>for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was <br>responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio.<Br> He founded the Free India Center in Berlin, and created the Indian Legion<BR> (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for<BR> the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces.<BR><BR> The Indian Legion was attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS.<BR> Its members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: "I swear by God this holy oath<BR> that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler,<Br> as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader<BR> is Subhas Chandra Bose".<BR> <BR>This oath clearly abrogated control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces<Br> whilst stating Bose's overall leadership of India. He was also, however, prepared to<BR> envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion;<BR><BR> Many have questioned his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily<BR> persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.<BR>

<BR>  Soon, according to historian Romain Hayes, "the (German) Foreign Office procured a luxurious residence for (Bose) along with a butler, cook,<BR> gardener, and an SS-chauffeured car. Emilie Schenkl moved in openly with him. The Germans, aware of the nature of the relationship,<BR> refrained from any involvement." However, most of the staff in the Special Bureau for India, which had been set up to aid Bose, did not get<BR> along with Emilie.<BR><BR> In particular Adam von Trott, Alexander Werth and Freda Kretschemer, according to historian Leonard A. Gordon, "appear to have disliked <br>her intensely. They believed that she and Bose were not married and that she was using her liaison with Bose to live an especially <BR>comfortable life during the hard times of war" and that differences were compounded by issues of class.<br><br> In November 1942, Schenkl gave birth to their daughter.
  
  The Germans were unwilling to form an alliance with Bose<BR> because they considered him unpopular in comparison with Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.<br><br> By the spring of 1942, the German army was mired in the USSR. Bose, due to disappointment over the lack of response from Nazi Germany,<br> was now keen to move to Southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories. However, he still expected<BR> official recognition from Nazi Germany.<br><BR> Adolf Hitler during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 refused to entertain Bose's requests and facilitated him with a<BR> submarine voyage to East Asia.
  
 <br><br> In February 1943, Bose left Schenkl and their baby daughter and boarded a German submarine to travel, via transfer to a Japanese submarine,<BR> to Japanese-occupied southeast Asia. In all, 3,000 Indian prisoners of war signed up for the Free India Legion.<Br> But instead of being delighted, Bose was worried. A left-wing admirer of Russia, he was devastated when Hitler's tanks rolled across the Soviet border. Matters were worsened by the fact that the now-retreating German army would be in no position to offer him help in driving the British from India.<BR><BR> When he met Hitler in May 1942, his suspicions were confirmed, and he came to believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men<BR> to win propaganda victories than military ones. So, in February 1943, Bose boarded a German U-boat and left for Japan.<BR> This left the men he had recruited leaderless and demoralised in Germany.
